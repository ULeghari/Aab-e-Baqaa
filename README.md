# Aab-e-Baqaa

Pakistan faces a growing water scarcity crisis, worsened by climate change, depleting water resources, and inefficient management. Traditional approaches to water resource management are often reactive, focusing on crisis response.
Aab-e-Baqaa addresses this issue by leveraging satellite imagery and deep learning techniques to predict areas at risk of water scarcity. The system monitors surface water levels, land use, and groundwater data, providing actionable insights that enable proactive decision-making for water resource management.
This project aims to equip policymakers with the tools to manage water resources effectively and mitigate the impacts of water scarcity in Pakistan.
